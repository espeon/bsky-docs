## Overview

Lexicons are the schema definitions that power the AT Protocol. They define the structure of records, queries, procedures, and subscriptions used throughout the network.

This documentation is auto-generated from the official [atproto repository](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/tree/main/lexicons).

## Lexicon Types

Lexicons can define several types of operations:

- **Records** - Data structures that can be stored in repositories (e.g., posts, profiles, likes)
- **Queries** - Read-only operations to fetch data from a server
- **Procedures** - Operations that modify server state
- **Subscriptions** - Real-time event streams
